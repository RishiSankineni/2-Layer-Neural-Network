# 2 Layer-Neural-Network
A Neural Network in 11 lines of Python.

This tutorial teaches backpropagation via a very simple toy example, a short python implementation.

Reference- http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/ 

Python 3.5 compatible. You only have to modify xrange() to range() in the code, because Py3 doesn't support xrange().
